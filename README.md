## üìò Content Overview 
The codebase includes Verilog module implementations and corresponding testbenches for **three main exercises**, progressively increasing in complexity and design scope.

### Exercise 1: Fundamental Logic Blocks
This exercise covered the design and implementation of basic digital logic components. It consisted of three independent questions:
1. Implementation of a **3-to-8 decoder** using a hierarchical structure built from 2-to-4 decoders.
1. Description and verification of an **SR flip-flop** (Set-Reset) circuit in Verilog.
1. Debugging, testing, and verification of a provided **8-bit multiplication** algorithm.

### Exercise 2: Bus Architecture Implementation and Analysis
This exercise explored the design of **shared data bus architectures**, emphasizing multiple implementation strategies and delay analysis.  
Unlike the previous exercise, the three parts of this assignment were interrelated.  
- The goal was to design an **N-bit shared bus** using two different methods:  
    1. **Tri-state buffer approach**
    1. **Multiplexer-based approach**
- The implementations were compared by introducing explicit signal delays in Verilog and analyzing the resulting timing differences.
- A **Python script** was used to generate and visualize the final timing and structural diagrams, illustrating propagation delay and signal control across the two bus architectures.

### Exercise 3: 8-bit Simple Processor Design
This was the main project of the course, involving the architectural design and Verilog implementation of a simplified **8-bit processor**.  
It combined **gate-level modeling** for fundamental arithmetic modules with **behavioral modeling** for higher-level system components.  
**Main components implemented:**  
- **Adder/Subtractor** (`csa_16.v`) ‚Äî Designed using gate-level modeling for precise logic-level representation.  
- **Multiplier** and **Divider** ‚Äî Implemented behaviorally to extend the arithmetic unit capabilities.  
- **ALU** (`alu.v`) ‚Äî Integrates adder, subtractor, multiplier, and divider modules into a single arithmetic logic unit.  
- **Register File** and **Memory** ‚Äî Modeled for data storage and instruction handling.  
- **Controller (Top-Level Module)** ‚Äî Coordinates the datapath and control signals to implement basic processor operations.  
Each module was tested using dedicated Verilog testbenches, ensuring correctness.  
The `syn/` directory contains the synthesized results of this design.  
The processor implementation is fully synthesizable, meaning it follows structural and behavioral conventions suitable for hardware realization on FPGA or ASIC platforms.



## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies
The projects are implemented using **Verilog HDL** and cover fundamental concepts. The simulations are primarily performed using **Icarus Verilog** and analyzed with **GTKWave**.

- Hardware Description Language (HDL): Verilog
- Simulation Tool: Icarus Verilog
- Synthesis Tool: Quartus (Used in exercise 3)
- Waveform viewer: GTKWave 
- Scripting: Python (Used in exercise 2 for delay analysis)



## üß© How to Install
Before running simulations or synthesizing designs, make sure the following tools are installed on your system.
All are free and cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS).

### 1. Verilog
Verilog itself is a hardware description language - you only need a **compiler/simulator** to work with it (such as Icarus Verilog or ModelSim).
If you're editing Verilog code, you can use **VS Code** with extensions
You don't install Verilog as a separate tool - you just use it through simulators or synthesis software like Icarus or Quartus.

### 2. Icarus
Icarus Verilog (iverilog) is an open-source Verilog simulator used in this course for all experiments and testbenches:  
#### üêß Linux / macOS
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install iverilog
```  
#### ü™ü Windows
1. Download the latest stable release from: 
  üîó https://bleyer.org/icarus/
1. Run the installer and make sure to add `iverilog` and `vvp` to PATH.
1. Verify installation:  
```bash
iverilog -V
vvp -V
```

### 3. GTKWave
GTKWave is a waveform viewer used to visualize `.vcd` files generated by your Verilog simulations.
#### üêß Linux
```bash
sudo apt install gtkwave
```
#### ü™ü Windows
1. Download from:
  üîó https://sourceforge.net/projects/gtkwave/
1. Install and add it to PATH
#### üß† Tip
Use `$dumpfile` and `$dumpvars` in your testbenches to create `.vcd` waveforms:  
```
initial begin
  $dumpfile("module_name.vcd");
  $dumpvars(0, module_name_tb);
end
```
### 4. Quartus (Optional - for synthesis)
Although not required for simulation in this course, Intel Quartus Prime can be used to synthesize and analyze your Verilog designs from exercise 3.

**Download** app from Official Intel link:
üîó https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/programmable/quartus-prime/download.html
**Recommended edition**: Quartus Prime Lite Edition (free version) -> Works on Windows and Linux
**Installation Notes**  
During installation, you can choose the FPGA family (e.g., Cyclone V) - any basic family works for functional synthesis.  
Add Quartus binary folder to your PATH if you want to run it from terminal.



## ‚öôÔ∏è How to run / simulate 
Follow the workflow below to **compile, run, and visualize your simulations**.

### Recommended simulation workflow:  

#### 1. Clone the repository 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmirMohammad-Sharbati/digital-system-design.git
cd digital-system-design
```  

#### 2. Compile
Use **Icarus Verilog (iverilog)** to compile all relevant Verilog source files (`.v`) and the corresponding testbench (`_TB.v`) into a single executable file (`vvp`):
```bash
iverilog -o <simulation_name>.vvp <list-of-source-files> <testbench_file>.v
```

#### 3. Run
Execute the compiled file using vvp to generate the output waveform file (`.vcd`):
```bash
vvp <simulation_name>.vvp
```

#### 4. View Results
Open the generated `.vcd` file in **GTKWave** for waveform inspection:
```bash
gtkwave <simulation_name>.vcd
```

### Example
Here is a practical example for simulating:
```bash
iverilog -o shift_rotate_2.vvp SR_FF.v shift_rotate_2.v shift_rotate_TB_2.v
vvp shift_rotate_2.vvp
gtkwave shift_rotate_2.vcd
```


### Synthesizable Processor (Exercise 3)
The codes located in `exercise_3/verilog_codes/` directory are designed to be **synthesizable**. 
While Icarus Verilog is used for functional simulation, tools like **Quartus** would be used for actual synthesis into a gate-level netlist. The simulation commands remain the same, but the code structure emphasizes synthesizable constructs.

#### Synthesis Workflow (Quartus Example)
1. Open Quartus.
1. Create a new project and add all Verilog source files (`.v`) from `exercise_3/verilog_codes/`.
1. Set the **top-level entity** to main controller module (`controller.v`).
1. Run the following processes:
    - Analysis & Synthesis
    - Compilation
    - Optionally RTL Viewer to visualize your synthesized logic.

### Python Script (Exercise 2)
The Python script in `exercise_2/` generates diagrams (requires Python 3.x). To run:  
```bash
cd exercise_2
python diagram.py
```  
Ensure Python 3.x and matplotlib are installed: 
```bash
pip install matplotlib 
```
